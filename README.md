# üìä WebProject: Excel-to-Web-Input Converter

## Project Overview

This application is a **dedicated tool for converting elements from an uploaded Excel spreadsheet ('.xlsx' file) into structured input parameters** for further processing or display.
It uses a Python backend to handle file uploads and data extraction, providing a seamless bridge between spreadsheet data and web application inputs.

The architecture suggests a workflow where users upload a spreadsheet, the Python backend (`app.py`) parses the data,
and the results are presented or processed via web pages handled by the `templates/` and `static/` folders.

## üåü Key Features

* **Excel File Uploads:** Supports uploading standard `.xlsx` files (handled in the `uploads/` directory).
* **Data Extraction & Conversion:** Reads data from the Excel sheet and transforms the elements into structured input parameters.
* **Dynamic Output:** Presents the converted data and processing results via web pages (`templates/`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Notes |
---------------------------------
| **Backend** | Python (`app.py`) |**Flask** . **Required library:** `openpyxl` and `pandas` for Excel parsing. |
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Used for the user interface and handling file selection. |
| **Templates** | Jinja2 | The default engine used by Flask (or your Python web framework) for rendering dynamic HTML |
| **Database** |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your system:

* **Python** 
* **Git*

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Since you are a collaborator, clone the repository directly:
    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/Krishna10016668/WebProject.git](https://github.com/Krishna10016668/WebProject.git)
    cd WebProject
    ```

2.  **Set up the Environment**
    Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it:
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    You will likely need a `requirements.txt` file. If one does not exist, ask your teammate to create one listing all libraries, including the Excel parsing tool.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

Start the server using the main application file:

```bash
python app.py
